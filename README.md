# TermuxRubyApi

TermuxRubyApi is a Gem that provides a Ruby interface to a lot of
Android functionality thanks to [Termux](https://termux.com/) and
[Termux API](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API).


```ruby
require 'termux_ruby_api'

# Connect to the API
t_api = TermuxRubyApi::Base.new

# Get a list of the latest 50 calls
call_log = t_api.call_log.log(limit: 50)

# Get the total seconds spent in outgoing calls
total_duration = call_log.select { |c| c[:type] == :OUTGOING }.map {|c| c[:duration] }.sum

# Get the result in Text To Speak
t_api.tts.speak("The total duration is #{total_duration} seconds")
```

[Termux](https://termux.com/) is a set of Android apps that provide a
complete Debian-like environment for Android, including Ruby, RubyGems
and a whole lot of other packages.

Part of that package, Termux API provides a way to invoke specific
Android functionality, like sending SMS, reading the call log,
accessing the GPS, initiating a phone call and more.

Termux API offers this connection by means of shell scripts that
accept command arguments and return data in JSON format.

TermuxRubyApi provides a convenient access to these scripts from the
confort of a set of Ruby classes that encapsulate all their
functionality and that allows the user to apply all the power and
flexibility of Ruby to access and manipulate this data, interacting
with the Android host.
